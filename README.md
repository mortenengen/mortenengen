# Morten Engen

Hey there 👋

👷‍♂️ I'm a civil engineer from Norway with a PhD in structural engineering and a passion for coding!

👨‍💻 I currently work at [Multiconsult](https://github.com/multiconsult-Group/) where I design concrete shell structures and contribute to value creation through automating our structural design process. I have developed a couple of [internal Python packages](https://multiconsult-group.github.io/caliber/) that I am activaly maintaining, and now and then I get to jump into some old FORTRAN code we have lying around that need some care 🦖.

👨‍🏫 I have a position as an adjunct associate professor at NTNU Trondheim where I teach design of concrete shell structures.

🚀 I like to explore ways of improving how structural engineers work by adopting technology from computer science.

🐍 I code mainly in Python and HTML, and occasionally, FORTRAN, and I am not afraid of getting my hands dirty in Typescript and Javascript.

✅ I use tools and platforms like Azure, Azure DevOps, Github Actions, Heroku, Jira, Speckle and Docusaurus.

📦 I develop around Python packages like Flask, Rich, Pydantic, Typer, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Plotly and Dash, supported by tools like Black, Pylint, Mypy and Pytest.

🙋‍♂️ I am interested in test-driven design, workflow automation, web-application development, Python packaging and CLI applications.

👓 I am looking forward to exploring VS Code Extensions, Cython and Tailwind CSS.
